---

## Introduction

Due to the nature of these community clients being separated from Steam's infrastructure, you can't add friends through Steam and join their games directly. Instead, you'll need to connect to an active match using a VPN solution like Radmin VPN or by port forwarding.

## Prerequisites

- One of the supported game clients installed:
  - [BOIII (Black Ops 3)](/games/boiii)
  - [S1x (Advanced Warfare)](/games/s1x)
  - [IW6x (Ghosts)](/games/iw6x)
  - [H1-Mod (Modern Warfare Remastered)](/games/h1-mod)
  - [IW7-Mod (Infinite Warfare)](/games/iw7-mod)
  - [HMW (HorizonMW)](/games/hmw)
- The client executable in your game folder

## Client Port Numbers

| Client | Port |
|--------|------|
| BOIII | `27017` |
| S1x | `27016` |
| IW6x | `27016` |
| H1-Mod | `27016` |
| IW7-Mod | `27016` |
| HMW | `27016` |
