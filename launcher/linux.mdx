    Download **[cb-launcher.exe](https://github.com/CBServers/updater/raw/main/updater/cb-launcher/cb-launcher.exe)** and save it to a folder you'll remember (e.g., `~/Games/CBLauncher/`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add as a non-Steam game">
    Open Steam and click **Add a Game** in the bottom left corner, then select **Add a Non-Steam Game**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse for the launcher">
    Click **Browse** and navigate to where you saved `cb-launcher.exe`. Select it and click **Open**, then click **Add Selected Programs**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Proton compatibility">
    Find `cb-launcher.exe` in your Steam library. Right-click it and select **Properties**, then go to the **Compatibility** tab.

    Check **Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool** and select a Proton version (Proton Hotfix is recommended).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch and configure">
    Click **Play** to start the launcher. When selecting a game install location, navigate to:
    1. Click into `/`
    2. Go to `home`
    3. Select your username
    4. Choose or create a folder for your games

    Your path should look like `Z:\home\yourusername\Games`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for installation">
    Select your game and wait for the download to complete. Once finished, you can play.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## For Steam Version Owners

If you own a supported game on Steam and want to use those files with the launcher, you need to enable hidden folders in the Wine file browser.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Protontricks">
    Install Protontricks on your system:
    - **Bazzite**: Pre-installed
    - **Other distros**: Install via Discover, Software Center, or your package manager
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Protontricks">
    Open Protontricks and select **non-steam shortcut: cb-launcher.exe** (or whatever name you gave it).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Wine">
    Wait for the dialog to appear, then select **Select the default wineprefix** and click **Run winecfg**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Show hidden files">
    In the Wine configuration window, click the **Drives** tab, then click **Show dot files** at the bottom. This allows the Wine file browser to show hidden folders like `.local`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Steam files">
    When setting up a game in the launcher, navigate to your Steam library folder. See the table below for common locations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Steam Library Paths

Steam's location varies depending on how it was installed:

| Installation Method | Steam Library Path |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Native (terminal/package manager) | `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/` |
| Steam Deck | `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/` |
| Flatpak | `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/` |
| Snap | `~/snap/steam/common/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/` |

<Note>
In the Wine file browser, these paths appear under `Z:\home\yourusername\` followed by the rest of the path. For example, a native Steam install would be at `Z:\home\yourusername\.local\share\Steam\steamapps\common\`.
