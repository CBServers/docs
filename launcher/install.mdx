## Game Requirements

Before running any game clients, ensure you have the common game redistributables installed.
You can install them by running this [script](https://chse.sh/redist). Credits to [Chase](https://chse.sh/).
<Tip>
The launcher has a Support page at the bottom of the sidebar with a script to install these redistributables automatically.
