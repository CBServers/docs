## How to Use

Type `/ah <weapon> <attachment> <anim>` to set your afterhit weapon.

- `<weapon>` — any weapon in H2M, or one of the specials listed below (no spaces in weapon names)
- `<attachment>` — name of attachment (optional)
- `<anim>` — animation to play (optional, defaults to canswap). See the [animations list](#animations) below

You can also apply just an animation to your current weapon:
- `/ah <anim>` — apply an animation to your current weapon after you hit

**Examples:**
- `/ah mantle` — current weapon with climbing animation
- `/ah vector reddot inspect` — Vector + Red Dot with inspect animation
- `/ah ak47 sprint` — AK-47 with sprinting animation
- `/ah laptop` — Laptop killstreak pull-out

You can preview your afterhit by typing `/ah preview` after setting it.

To remove your afterhit, type `/ah reset`.
