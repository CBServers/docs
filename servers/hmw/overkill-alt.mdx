The Overkill and Alt commands let you equip additional weapons beyond your normal loadout.

## How to Use

Type `/overkill <weapon> <attachment>` to replace your secondary with any weapon in the game.

Type `/alt <weapon> <attachment>` to add a third weapon.

The `<attachment>` parameter is optional.

**Examples:**
- `/overkill vector reddot` — Vector with Red Dot as secondary
- `/alt stg44` — STG44 as a third weapon
- `/overkill g3` — G3 as secondary
- `/alt zombie` — Zombie hands as a third weapon

To remove your Overkill or Alt weapon, type `/overkill reset` or `/alt reset`.
