## Prerequisites

- Be in a Trickshot Server for the desired game

## Written Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join a trickshot server">
    Join any of our trickshotting servers for the game you want your VIP fixed on. For example, if you want your VIP fixed on H2M-Mod, join one of our H2M-Mod servers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your Client ID">
    Type `!who` **in game chat** (not in Discord) and hit enter.

    You should get a message from the server that includes your **Client ID**. It's the 5 digit number following the @ symbol.
