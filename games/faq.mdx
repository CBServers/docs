This page covers common issues and questions specific to individual game clients. For launcher-related issues, see the [Launcher FAQ](/launcher/faq).

## General Game Issues

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Why won't my game launch or start?">
    There are several common causes:

    1. **Missing Dependencies** - Install the [required redistributables](https://chse.dev/redists) first
    2. **Windows Security Settings** - In Windows Security settings, go to **App & browser control → Exploit protection settings** and turn off "Force randomization for images". Then, go to **Device security → Core isolation details** and turn off "Memory integrity". Restart your PC after making these changes. If the game still doesn't launch, try running the game's executable as administrator (right-click → Run as administrator).
    3. **Steam Required** - Some games require Steam to be running (you don't need to own the game, just have Steam open)
    4. **Corrupt Files** - Verify your game files in the launcher
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does my game say 'Steam must be running'?">
    Some games require Steam to be open, even if you downloaded them through the CB Launcher. You don't need to own the game on Steam - just have the Steam application running in the background. You can also try adding `-nosteam` to the game's launch properties, though this doesn't work for all games.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I change my in-game name?">
    For most clients (except Plutonium which requires an account), open the console using the tilde (`~`) key and type:
    ```
    /name yourname
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## HMW (HorizonMW)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I tried all the steps above and I'm still crashing on HMW">
    You may need to disable the CB Extension if you're still experiencing crashes. Open HMW game settings in the launcher and enable "Disable CB Extension".
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I unlock all items in HMW?">
    Use the "Unlock All" button in the launcher on the HMW page. This feature was recently fixed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I fix the 'Disk read imagefile59' error?">
    Delete `config_mp.cfg` from your `players2` folder. When you load back up, you'll need to redo your settings.

    Then, make sure you keep **"Fill remaining memory"** turned off. This can be found in **Options → Graphics**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## IW7-Mod (Infinite Warfare)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All options in the menu are locked">
    You need to create a class first:
    1. Click "Create Class"
    2. Choose one of the rig types
    3. Create your class
    4. The server browser will then unlock
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm getting 'Disc Read Errors'">
    Try verifying your game files in the launcher. This error typically indicates corrupted or missing files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm getting 'Memory Errors'">
    Make sure Steam is open when launching the game.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My game is stuck on '[Updater] Downloading file X'">
    The client is downloading required files in the background. This may not appear to be progressing, but please wait and the game will launch once the update completes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Game gets stuck loading or shows a black screen when starting Muliplayer or Zombies match">
    Open the console using the tilde (`~`) key and enter:
    ```
    map_start_fix 1
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## IW6x (Ghosts)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My controller or mouse isn't working in the menus">
    This is a known issue. Execute the `vid_restart` command in the console.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Playing with Friends

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I play private matches with friends?">
    Due to these clients being separated from Steam's infrastructure, you can't add friends the traditional way. Instead, you need to use a VPN solution like Radmin VPN or port forward.

    Full guide available at: [Private Match Guide](/guides/private-match)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My friend gets disconnected when trying to join my private match">
    Make sure you've properly configured port forwarding or are using a VPN solution like Radmin VPN. See the [Private Match Guide](/guides/private-match) for setup instructions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
